# Travelora - A Basic Front-End Website
![](https://durgadevi-webapp.web.app/assets/travel-BTk99Z4A.png)
I created Travelora, a simple front-end website using React. Through this project, I learned:

- Setting up a React project with dependencies
- Working with components and conditional rendering
- Displaying lists dynamically
- Debugging and troubleshooting errors independently as part of self-learning
- You can check out the live version here: [Live Demo](https://travelora-hosting.web.app/)
